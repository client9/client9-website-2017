The size of a fresh Linux install on EC2 is a rough proxy for it's
complexity, how big the attack surface is and how frequently it will
need updates.  Less is definitely *more*.  In 2015, I [compared the
number of packages on default install on AWS
EC2](/article/comparison-of-linux-distributions-on-aws-ec2/).  Let's
see how things changed or not.  This time, in addition to the number
of packages installed, I also checked on-disk image size.  Corrections
and additions welcome.<!--more-->

Notes:

* In general, everything is bigger.
* [Amazon Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/) is completely unoptimized for size.  You decide if
  that is surprising or not.
* Ubuntu continues its march to 1GB images. Every LTS release appears
  to add 100MB.
* While [Debian 8.3](https://www.debian.org/News/2016/20160123) and
  Ubuntu 16 should be similar, the difference between the two is over
  250MB.  What is Ubuntu actually adding?
* [CentOS](https://www.centos.org) and
  [RedHat](http://www.redhat.com/en) I thought were near identical,
  but RedHat is 100MB larger.
* [CoreOS](https://coreos.com) has a minimal 541MB install, however I
  might be measuring this incorrectly.
* I found [Fedora Cloud](https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/) last year by
  accident.  I still have no idea what it is.  The web site says
  mostly nothing.
* This year, I found [CentOS Atomic
  Host](http://seven.centos.org/?p=579).  Both this and the previous
  image appear to be based on [Project
  Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io) sponsored by RedHat.  It
  appears the a CoreOS-style host for running docker or other
  containers.  Except the image is 1G!  A quick inspection turned up a
  host of not-quite-empty directories for various X-windows and
  desktop applications, 65MB for firmware updates, and on and on.  Not
  inspiring.
* [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) works on EC2 but is
  only semi-supported.  I was hoping it would be more minimal but it's
  same size of RedHat or Ubuntu.
* SUSE was checked last year, but it's excluded since it's ridiculous.

In conclusion, the choices for a truly cloud-first, server-first
operating system are quite limited. The Major Vendor's approach is to
take a full-fat image and then delete things (or not) to make a
cloud edition. So far this has produced less-than-great results.
CoreOS certainly is doing something original and different, but it is
highly opinionated (this is good!), and leaves open plenty of room for
improvement and opportunities for innovation.  I fail to see why a
full OS couldn't be under 250MB.
