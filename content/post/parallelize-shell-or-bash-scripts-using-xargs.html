title: Parallelize Shell or Bash Scripts Using Xargs
---
<p>Who doesn&#39;t want to go faster? It is common to have a setup script that downloads various packages or tools. Here&#39;s an example: </p>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code class="p-1">#!/bin/sh -ex</code></pre>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code class="p-1"># hugo https://gohugo.io
go get github.com/gohugoio/hugo</code></pre>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code class="p-1"># https://github.com/client9/misspell
./godownloader-misspell 0.3.4</code></pre>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code class="p-1"># shellcheck.net
docker pull koalaman/shellcheck</code></pre>
<p>It runs one line after another in serial. That&#39;s slow.</p>
<p>But notice how each line doesn&#39;t depend on any other (and comment and blank lines don&#39;t matter). If you can write a script in such a way, then you really speed things up by running in parallel using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs">xargs</a>:</p>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code class="p-1">cat setup.sh | xargs -P4 -ICMD /bin/sh -exc CMD</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s it. Your script could run 4x faster.</p>
<p>Where <code class="p-1">-P4</code> is number of processes to run in parallel. Since most of the time it is network calls, there is no harm in making this 8 or even 16.</p>
<p>Where <code class="p-1">-ICMD</code> is ... is the magic of mixing xargs and shell. You can use something else other than <code class="p-1">CMD</code> if you want. It&#39;s the <code class="p-1">-I</code> that&#39;s important and using the same word as the last arg. </p>
<p>You can run the setup in serial (normal) for debugging and one-time setups, and in parallel to speed up runs on CI/CD systems such as <a href="https://travis-ci.org">travis-ci</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.codeword.xyz/2015/09/02/three-ways-to-script-processes-in-parallel/">other ways</a> to parallelize scripts, but this is easiest.</p>

<p><a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a> uses <a href="https://busybox.net">busybox</a> version of xargs which does not support <code class="p-1">-P</code>.  You&#39;ll have to install <a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/contents?file%3D%26path%3D%26name%3Dfindutils%26branch%3Dedge%26repo%3Dmain%26arch%3Dx86">findutils</a> to get the proper <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/">GNU xargs</a></p>
