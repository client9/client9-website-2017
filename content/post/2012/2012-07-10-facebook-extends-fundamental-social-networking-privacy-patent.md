One of many jobs Friendster (yes Friendster), was managing privacy
issues.  In 2010, [Facebook purchased Friendster's patents](http://gigaom.com/2010/08/04/facebook-buys-friendster-patents-for-40m/) (for $40m!) and as part of the review process looked at extending or enhancing the original applications.  The result of this is **[US Patent 8,219,500](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=8219500.PN.&OS=PN/8219500&RS=PN/8219500)** which Chris Lunt [@chrislunt](https://twitter.com/chrislunt) and myself are listed as inventors.

### [System and method for managing information flow between members of an online social network](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=8219500.PN.&OS=PN/8219500&RS=PN/8219500) ###

> An online social network is provided in which members of the online
> social network control who may view their personal information and who
> may communicate with them. The members control who may view their
> personal information by setting a visibility preference. A member may
> not view another member's full personal profile if the measure of
> relatedness between the two is greater than the visibility preference
> of the other member. The members also control who may communicate with
> them by setting a contactability preference. A member may not
> communicate with another member if the measure of relatedness between
> the two is greater than the contactability preference of the other
