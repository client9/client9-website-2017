> Rate Limiting in Action
> Nick Galbreath, Director of Engineering, Etsy
> Rate limiting is a useful technique to limit malicious and undesirable
> behavior on web services. This talk will present a simple rate limit
> implementation using memcached that allows one to easily add rate
> limiting anywhere in their application. Weâ€™ll then cover some
> (surprising) real-world uses of rate limits, how to distinguish
> between enthusiasm and maliciousness, and finally some of the common
> countermeasures that are used.
