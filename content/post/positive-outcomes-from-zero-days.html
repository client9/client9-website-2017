title: Positive Outcomes from Zero Days
---
<p>In March 2017 the <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a> released a report “<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1751.html">Zero Days, Thousands of Nights</a>: The Life and Times of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities and Their Exploits”. The goal was to assess the public policy of governments stockpiling or releasing so-called 0-day exploits. While that remains an open question, the report and underlying data set of real-world exploits provides valuable insights into software engineering for security and resilience. This talk will provide an overview of the report and what it means for builders and defenders.</p>
