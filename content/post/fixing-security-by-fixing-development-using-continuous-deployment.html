<p>Do you have an effective release cycle? Is your process long and archaic? Long release cycle are typically based on assumptions we haven&#39;t seen since the 1980s and require very mature organizations to implement successfully. They can also disenfranchise developers from caring or even knowing about security or operational issues. Attend this session to learn more about an alternative approach to managing deployments through Continuous Deployment, otherwise known as Continuous Delivery. Find out how small, but frequent changes to the production environment can transform an organizationâ€™s development process to truly integrate security. Learn how to get started with continuous deployment and what tools and process are needed to make implementation within your organization a (security) success.</p>
