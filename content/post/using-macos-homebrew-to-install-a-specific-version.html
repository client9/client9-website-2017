title: Using macOS Homebrew to Install a Specific Version
---
<p>Here&#39;s how to install a specific version of a package on macOS using <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>. While the process isn&#39;t automatic, it&#39;s also not hard and provides stability.</p>
<h2 id="h.6ze0pe9ju0r9" class="h4 mt-4 mb-4">Why Isn&#39;t This Functionality Built-In?</h2>
<p>Homebrew used to provide this functionality. If you do search you&#39;ll probably find one these methods that no longer works. My guess is the team behind Homebrew removed the functionality since it never worked very well, at scale.</p>
<p>In most Linux distributions, formulas are in separate repositories and can change multiple times before being released with a manual process. The version number is handcrafted and can look like <code>1.2.3-rc2-ubuntu10</code>.</p>
<p>With homebrew, every formula is in one git repository and every git commit is a potentially a new release for all formula. This makes version numbers hard. For example let&#39;s say homebrew did a mass whitespace reformatting of the formula in one commit. Would every package need new version numbers?  How would you add them?  In a way that is consistent and doesn&#39;t have race conditions? </p>
<p>The good news is that getting the exact version you want already is indexed and ready, using git. It&#39;s more work, but it&#39;s more accurate too.</p>
<h2 id="h.tiqgv4ce1gp5" class="h4 mt-4 mb-4">Find the Hash, Locally</h2>
<p>If you are just trying to lock to the latest or a very recently edition, the fastest way is to use</p>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code>brew log -p NAME</code></pre>
<p>Then to <code>brew install</code> this version use the raw content from GitHub by replacing <code>_HASH_</code> and <code>_NAME_</code> appropriately:</p>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code>BREWURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core
brew install ${BREWURL}/HASH/Formula/NAME.rb</code></pre>
<h2 id="h.2gbyqv6gq4oq" class="h4 mt-4 mb-4">Find the Hash, Remote Edition</h2>
<p>Homebrew provided a nice command to pop open a browser window pointing to the change log of a formula:</p>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code>brew info --github NAME</code></pre>
<p>It takes a few clicks to get the full commit hash. First you&#39;ll have to click the <code>History</code> button, find the change you like, then click on another icon to get the full hash. It sounds gross, but in practice it&#39;s not too hard.</p>
<h2 id="h.uqqmtjqdh40m" class="h4 mt-4 mb-4">When GitHub Lets You Down</h2>
<p>The <code>Homebrew/homebrew-core</code> repo is very large and using GitHub to look at the commit history for a particular file may timeout. In this case you&#39;ll get a &#34;Sorry I&#39;m being lazy, go do it yourself&#34; message. OK then.</p>
<p>Also because it&#39;s so big, Homebrew only downloads a bit.  However, you can get the full Homebrew history with:</p>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code>git -C &#34;$(brew --repo homebrew/core)&#34; fetch --unshallow</code></pre>
<p>Then use git to find the entry you want:</p>
<pre class="p-1 pl-3"><code>git -C &#34;$(brew --repo homebrew/core)&#34; log master -- Formula/phantomjs.rb</code></pre>
<p>As before, craft the URL back to GitHub using the correct hash.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to install a specific version, it would be good time to review how `brew pin` works so you don&#39;t lose all your hard work.</p>
