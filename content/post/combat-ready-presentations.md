Draft: true
Title: Combat-ready presentations
---

For a pitch, almost everything I've read on "how to do a presentation is **completely wrong**.  You are not giving TED Talk.  you do not work at an advertising agency.  You are not a professional business graphics artist.  You are not summarizing your research. You do not have 90 hours to work on your deck. 

You are giving a pitch deck and probably running a company at the same time.


## Aspect Ratios

Use 16x9 is the current standard.

## three reasons to use 4x3

4:3 still has it's uses.  

## Table Presentabtion 

If you present off an iPad or other tablet the full screen is 4:3.   16x9 still works but not as nice.

## Paper Printouts

4:3 is a lot nicer if you need to print out you deck.

## Old VGA

Recently I have not seen any old VGA connectors but I know they are out there!   HDMI or DP have completely taken over. 

## 16x10

unlikely you'll encounter these.  your 16:9 presentation will have some gaps at the top and bottom (or perhaps stretched a bit).

google reports 330k results for "monitor 16x9" and only 90k for 16x10.


# what template should I use?

I know what you are thinking "Surely the artists and designer at Microsoft, Apple and Google has made templates that will work and I can just use one of those?"

No every one of them is not acceptable.  They seem ok to make deck showing your vacation photos or maybe a high school report but that's it.

## Low contrast

Many off the stock templates are low in contrast making them only suitable for displaying directly off your laptop.

## Poor font choices

Bad selection but also typically too way small
 and too or
 
## Wrong colors

it's unlikely any colors used will be anything close to your corporate colors

## Too decorative

they all have too much "chart junk"






However, the goal of the pitch is not to get married but to go on another date.

no one is writing a check as soon as you finish.  

the goal of the pitch is not to entertain your audience or show how artistic you are. In fact, if they remember the deck more than the idea then you have failed.



You will encounter:

* monitors missing an entire color channel
* monitors with ghosting or burn-in
* monitors with interference (snow, or lines)
* monitors with that are too big for the room
* monitors that are too small for the room
* monitors that completely scramble background images
 (No idea how this happens)
* monitors with poor color reproduction (too bright or dark, projectors, just bad)

And of course you'll encounter... monitors that don't work at all and you'll need present live off the laptop.

Likewise your audience

* may be old (ahem, meaning over 40) and have reduced contrast
* may have color vision defincies
* maybe be 50ft away from the screen
* maybe be in a remote office,  running over a slow or compressed link

## High Contrast

Virtually all the other tips are colloraries of this one.

### No Gray-on-Gray

There is almost no case where the design won't be better if the gray text where either all white or all black.

### Avoid bright color-on-color combinations.

An example is a dark blue background with a bright orange text.  You'll see green fringing on the edges with some low resolution monitors has the monitor tries to smooth edges.

If the color-on-color is invoking text or a logo, for maximaim crispness make it black or white.

Personally, I'd stick with black or white text.

### Go Big



### Skip the light-weight fonts

Keynote with your default of  Helvetica Neue Light, I'm looking at you!



## Be careful with italics

Many fonts don't have a true italic or bold-italic variation.  So either it just won't work or the presentation software fakes it with typically crappy results.

In general prefer **bold** for emphasis.

## Skip using underlines.

It looks horrible. Even for links.

## Buy two adaptors

## Obnoxiously label your adaptors

Partially to prevent other people from stealing them but also to remind yourself once you are done presenting to grab them.

## Keynote Users: Test export to Power Point

You are all set to present off your laptop, and at last minute they as for your PPT since the AV tech will preload it on the windows laptop.

## Buy a thumb-drive

Put the latest version,including a PDF.
If using Keynote or Google Docs, put a Power Point version on as well.

## Learn how to present with PDF

Apple's preview app has a special interface for presenting slides.  I'd be surprised with the official Adobe Reader did not have this.

## Learn how to present with your iPhone/iPad

If you have Keynote on your phone, you can present using AirPlay on AppleTV (which are not as rare as you'd think now days).

Even better you can buy an adaptor for your iPhone and plug directly into HDMI.


## What fonts should I use in Keynote

most of the fonts aren't even for use in any western language. 
many more are decorations or just ridiculous.



However there are the fonts that come in a wide variety of wights (how thick or thin) and have true italics, display both on MacOS and iOS, can be used to make numerical tables since numbers are tabular.

fonts

For general text and headlines

the Big 3 for Keynote in 2017 are:

* Avenir Next
* Helvetica Neue
* Gil Sans

You can make your entire presentation using just one of these.  In fact you probably should.

## But it's too boring

really one font is ok, but if you must you could use a serif font for titles and the main headline.  the size will hopefully be big enough so it looks ok.

The choices are limited in keynote that work well I. a pitch deck.

* Futura - excellent font but but missing true bold-italic and all the weight variations of the Big 3
* Optima
* Hoefler Text
* Palatino
* Georgia

and that's it.

## Font Twins


# what Color Should Then Background be

Ahould it be light text on dark background or dark text on a light background.?   
A common idiom is "if in a bright room use black on white, if in a dark room use white on black. and find out ahead of time and adjust". I've also heard this adjustment is needed so photographs come out better.

uh-huh.  that.s not happening.

in absence of being able to control things like brightness and contrast,  and not i owning what the environment will be, go white text on dark background.

### text is white

text should always be 100 white.  why?

colored text is weird and very likely to display poorly.

if you have a colored background and colored text, the poor monitor is going to interpolate between them sometimes to smooth out the text .  this results is gross color fringing around the text.

### background is solid dark

background should be dark.   you probably don't want pure black, mostly because it will look stark and some monitors will be cranked up to maximum brightness.

for more variety, one could make the header or footer a different than the main background.  But you don't have to.

There is another reason to use dark backgrounds.   it's likely at some point you'll be presenting next to the monitor.  with a light background you are going to that blue-white sickly light reflects on you.

### Avoid background gradients, "textures" or watermarks 

They are the slide equivalent of chart-junk.  for very subtle backgrounds they either don't show up at all or look like glitches and/or interfere with text and readability.  In any event they certainly add bloat to your presentation.

### Avoid full-frame background images

Cetainly the occasional use of full frame images is ok (especially for the title slide, and team pictures). But beyond that there are few reasons to reconsider the full-frame background image.  

Size: Ideally you'll want your presentation under 5MB so it can be emailed without duress from various corporate email servers or have gmail complain about a file being too big

Text Contrast: unless the image has large areas of white or dark space, getting text to stand out can be challenging.

Failure case: no idea why but I'll been at a few places where the projector is either so washed out you can't tell what the image is. Worse I've seen some that completely turned the background into a pixelated noises mess.

Consider using a image that goes fills the space horizontally but leaves enough room vertically to add your headline and footer.  


It's very possible you are sitting next to monitor.
