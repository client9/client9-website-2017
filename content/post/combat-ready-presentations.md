Title: Combat-ready presentations
---

You will encounter:

* monitors missing an entire color channel
* monitors with ghosting or burn-in
* monitors with interference (snow, or lines)
* monitors with that are too big for the room
* monitors that are too small for the room
* monitors that completely scramble background images
 (No idea how this happens)
* monitors with poor color reproduction (too bright or dark, projectors, just bad)

And of course you'll encounter... monitors that don't work at all and you'll need present live off the laptop.

Likewise your audience

* may be old (ahem, meaning over 40) and have reduced contrast
* may have color vision defincies
* maybe be 50ft away from the screen
* maybe be in a remote office,  running over a slow or compressed link

## High Contrast

Virtually all the other tips are colloraries of this one.

### No Gray-on-Gray

There is almost no case where the design won't be better if the gray text where either all white or all black.

### Avoid bright color-on-color combinations.

An example is a dark blue background with a bright orange text.  You'll see green fringing on the edges with some low resolution monitors has the monitor tries to smooth edges.

If the color-on-color is invoking text or a logo, for maximaim crispness make it black or white.

Personally, I'd stick with black or white text.

### Go Big

### Avoid background gradients, "textures" or watermarks 

They are the slide equivalent of chart-junk.  for very subtle backgrounds they either don't show up at all or look like glitches and/or interfere with text and readability.  In any event they certainly add bloat to your presentation.

### Skip the light-weight fonts

Keynote with your default of  Helvitica Neue Light, I'm looking at you!

### Be careful the full-frame background image

Cetainlly the occasional use of full frame images is ok (especially for the title slide, and team pictures).   But beyond that there are few reasons to reconsider the full-frame background image.  

Size: Ideally you'll want your presentation under 5MB so it can be emailed without duress from various corporate email servers or have gmail complain about a file being too big

Text Contrast:  unless the image has large areas of white or dark space, getting text to stand out can be challenging.

Failure case:  no idea why but I'll been at a few places where the rproject is either so washed out you can't tell what the image is.  Worse I've seen some that completely  turned the background  into a pixelated noises mess.

Consider using a image that goes fills the space horizontally but leaves enough room vertically to add your headline and footer.  


## Be careful with italics

Many fonts don't have a true italic or bold-italic variation.  So either it just won't work or the presentation software fakes it with typically crappy results.

In general prefer **bold** for emphasis.

## Skip using underlines.

It looks horrible.

## Buy two adaptors

## Obnoxiously label your adaptors

Partially to prevent other people from stealing them but also to remind yourself once you are done present to grab them.

## Keynote Users: Test export to Power Point


## Buy a thumb-drive

Put the latest version,including a PDF.
If using Keynote or Google Docs, put a Power Point version on as well.

## Learn how to present with PDF

Apple's preview app has a special interface for presenting slides.  I'd be surprised with the official Adobe Reader did not have this.

## Learn how to present with your iPhone/iPad

If you have Keynote on your phone, you can present using AirPlay on AppleTV (which are not as rare as you'd think now days).

Even better you can buy an adaptor for your iPhone and plug directly into HDMI.


fonts

For general text and headlines

the Big 3 for Keynote in 2017 are:

* Avenir Next
* Helvetica Neue
* Gil Sans

All of these come in huge variety of weights plus italic faces.  You can make your entire presentation using just one of these.

* Futura - excellent font but but missing true bold-italic and all the weight variations of the Big 3
* Trebuchet MS

The following old classics are available.  These certainly work but may inspire rage from your more design-oriented friends.

* Arial - no need since Helvetica Neue is present and better in every way.
* Avenir (original) - The weights are very non-standard or just missing in many cases.  Use Avenir Next.
* Helvetica (original) - numbers are not monospace, various minor defects are corrected in Neue version.
* Verdana - designed for small screens and small point sizes circa 1996.  On today screens it's horribly space inefficient.   It may be useful for legal notices, copyrights, and other notifications in very small sizes.

for numeric tables

If you have a lot of numbers with decimal points and fractions of different length, you are best off with Menlo or Courier (not Courier New as it is too light).

But if your tables are just whole numbers any of the following can be used 

* Avenir Next
* Gil Sans
* Helvetica Neue
* Trebuchet MS
* Verdana



More interesting is that you can use the following serif fonts as well

* Optima
* Baskerville
* Didot
* Bodoni

Monospace Fonts for code samples

Use menlo.  

Courier is not good. Courier New is even worse.  "American Typewriter" is not monosapce.

Serif fonts and text blocks

Completly optional for use in presentations however a serif font works well for quotations nd block quotes.  it's a good indicator that the text foreign to your.

They are also useful for headlines and titles.  The serif details remain crisp 

Your best bet is probably Georgia. Baskerville is quite different looking and as a bonus has a demi-bold and Demi-bold italic face.

The remaining three and tried and true classics that may be useful

* Georgia

* Baskerville
* Palatino


* Optima almost looks as if it's sans-serif
* Didot too thin
* Bodoni. too thin

* Times New Roman too dense


everything else in Keynote is not particularly useful.
