If a font is not installed it will render in `monospace`.

### Serif

This the default serif font, typically Times New Roman.

<p class="sample" style="font-family: serif;">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>

### Times New Roman

What's wrong with Times New Roman (TNY)?

* Used everywhere and is typically the default "unstyled" font.
* At a point-size that is too small
* A bit thin for screen use

That said at a larger point size it still looks good.

<p class="sample" style="font-family: times new roman, monospace">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. 0123456789<br>
0Oo il1I! 2z 8$s5S<br>
11111.11<br>
88888.88
</p>

### Athelas

Athelas is a system font on Macs and available in iBooks and Safari reader-mode.  It's similar in size to Times New Roman so it's almost a drop-in replacement with one exception: numbers. You'll have an opinion since Athelas numbers are:

* has large variation in width 
* has large descenders
* "one" is a small-caps of "capital I"

<p class="sample" style="font-family: athelas, monospace">

</p>

### Georgia

Georgia is on both Macs and Windows, making it a great fallback font, if not primary.

<p class="sample" style="font-family: Georgia, monospace">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.<br>
0123456789<br>
11111.11<br>
88888.88<br>
0Oo il1I! 2z 8$s5S
</p>

### Charter

Charter is used as an alternate font on Macs for iBook and Safari Reader.  It is a near drop-in replacement for Georgia and is a slightly lighter and uses tabular numbers.

<p class="sample" style="font-family: Charter, monospace">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.<br>
0123456789<br>
11111.11<br>
88888.88<br>
0Oo il1I! 2z 8$s5S
</p>

### Cambria

Microsoft ClearType font Cambria.  For Mac, [Charter might be the most similar](http://practicaltypography.com/cambria-alternatives.html).

<p class="sample" style="font-family: Cambria, monospace">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.<br>
0123456789<br>
11111.11<br>
88888.88<br>
0Oo il1I! 2z 8$s5S<br>
</p>

### Palatino

Another solid font available on both Macs as "Palatino" and Windows as "Palatino Linotype".  Some strokes in capital letters are a bit thin for screen use.

<p class="sample" style="font-family: Palatino, monospace">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.<br>
0123456789<br>
11111.11<br>
88888.88<br>
0Oo il1I! 2z 8$s5S
</p>

### Iowan Old Style

"Iowan Old Style" (not "Iowan") is a font available on Macs for use with iBook and Safari reader.  It's a solid upgrade from Palatino and is a touch heavier making it better for the screen. Unlike Palatino, it uses tabular numbers.

<p class="sample" style="font- family: Iowan Old Style, monospace">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.<br>

0Oo il1I! 2z 8$s5S<br>
</p>

### Hoefler Text

This Mac-only font was designed to show off features in Apple typography.  That said, the font has some very thin lines and the bold is really heavy.  I won't recommend it for screen body text.

<p class="sample" style="font-family: Hoefler Text, monospace">
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG.<br>
