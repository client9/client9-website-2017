## General Guidelines on Size and Contrast

* [How The Web Became Unreadable](https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.gqhmlwt6u)
* [Contrast Rebellion](http://contrastrebellion.com)
* [Your Body Text Is Too Small](https://blog.attackthefront.io/your-body-text-is-too-small-5e02d36dc902#.ab5myen3s)

## Fonts

The combination of Lato (the headlines) and Merriweather (the body text) is from
[10 Awesome Google Font Combinations](https://theclientclass.com/google-font-combinations/).

## Links and Underlines

Wow, default underlining for links looks horrible!

Here's some tricks:

* [Crafting link underlines on Medium](https://medium.design/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9#.ericl0z92)
* [Styling Underlines on the Web](https://css-tricks.com/styling-underlines-web/)

Uh, I'm not doing crazy drop shadow/canvas/etc tricks.  To make the underline look less chunky, I made it gray.

Samples:

* Regular body text: <span class="underline">ampers@nds_or_underscores and http://links</span>.
* Computer code text: <span class="underline"><code>ampers@nds_or_underscores and http://links<code></span>
