Do you have an effective release cycle? Is your process long and
archaic? Long release cycle are typically based on assumptions we
haven't seen since the 1980s and require very mature organizations to
implement successfully. They can also disenfranchise developers from
caring or even knowing about security or operational issues. Attend
this session to learn more about an alternative approach to managing
deployments through Continuous Deployment, otherwise known as
Continuous Delivery. Find out how small, but frequent changes to the
production environment can transform an organizationâ€™s development
process to truly integrate security. Learn how to get started with
continuous deployment and what tools and process are needed to make
implementation within your organization a (security) success.
