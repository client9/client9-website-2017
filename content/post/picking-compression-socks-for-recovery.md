There many [benefits to wearing compression socks](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=benefits+of+compression+socks&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) after doing a workout, but most importantly, it just feels good.  But which one to get? Requirements:

* Under $40
* Fairly boring looking and with limiting branding.
* Made by a company that actually seems to know what they are doing.

Companies that used lots of words or branding, got ignored.  Companies that can't figure how to list their products on  Amazon correctly, got ignored.  Companies that are just resellers, got ignored.

In the end, the short list includes four companies.  I'm sure one will meet your requirements.


## [CEP](http://www.cepcompression.com)

[CEP](http://www.cepcompression.com) is the sports brand of [Medi](https://www.medi-corporate.com/en/), a German medical company.  They are the only company in the list that directly makes their own products (they own the factories). 

* Made in Germany
* Sizing based on calf circumference. You need a [tape measure](http://amzn.to/2ewTFtr).
* Material
  * 85% polyamide (a type of nylon)
  * 15% [Spandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandex)
* Left/Right specific socks.
* Branding is on side of calf, not too obnoxious.

## 2XU

The origin story is interesting.  The founders in Australia saw another local company do compression clothing and thought they could do it better.  Today, given the large number of sports teams, celebrities, and military forces that use 2XU products, they appear to have succeeded.  I have no doubt their product is excellent.

* Made in China, because according the to CEO, their "[factories have the best sewing and cutting machines](https://www.ft.com/content/81617ea8-9b31-11e1-b097-00144feabdc0)".  Although they do not say this on their website or product marketing.
* Size based on calf circumference.  You need a [tape measure](http://amzn.to/2ewTFtr).
* Branding is a small "2XU" on back of calf. 
* Left/Right specific
* Material:
  * "100% Other Fibers" which is perhaps "High filament nylon yarn".
