title: Robots, Graphs and Binary Search
---
<p>Over at the <a href="https://codeascraft.com/">Code as Craft</a> blog by <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> is a new article on detecting and monitoring robotic traffic and the use of a <a href="https://github.com/client9/ipcat">IP categorization database</a>.  Here’s the intro:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote border-left border-left-thick pl-3">We love our human customers. That said we get a lot of traffic from robots too. This is great, especially when they use the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/developers">Etsy API</a>. However, they sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">misbehave</a>. And they misbehave frequently in the late hours, not unlike a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Robots">legendary East Village nightclub</a>. This time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Ferguson">Craig Ferguson</a> isn’t at the door to keep an eye on things. Instead we monitor the robots attending our night club with graphs.</blockquote>
