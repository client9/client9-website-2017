title: Rate-Limiting at Scale
---
<p>Rate Limiting in Action Nick Galbreath, Director of Engineering, Etsy. Rate limiting is a useful technique to limit malicious and undesirable behavior on web services. This talk will present a simple rate limit implementation using memcached that allows one to easily add rate limiting anywhere in their application. Weâ€™ll then cover some (surprising) real-world uses of rate limits, how to distinguish between enthusiasm and maliciousness, and finally some of the common countermeasures that are used.</p>
