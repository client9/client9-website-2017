title: Secure Application Development with Golang
---
<p>First presented at RSA USA 2015, Session ASD-F02 on April 24, 2015 in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>This might be the worst slide template I have ever used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are too small</li>
<li>Fonts are microsoft-specific</li>
<li>Font color is grey</li>
<li>Background is grey</li>
<li>Background has pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>It would seem itâ€™s specifically designed for not-reading. But if you can read it, the deck is still accurate in 2018.</p>
