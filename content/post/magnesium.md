## Bioavailability

  * Oxide is aborbed around 4%
  * lactate, asperate, chloride forms around 9-11%
  * Chelates not included

  * Compared Oxide vs. Citrate vs. "amino-acid chelate" (type unknown)
  * "Mg oxide supplementation resulted in no differences compared to placebo"
  * Concluded that Citrate was the best

  * In rats, studied absorption of  oxide, chloride, sulphate, carbonate, acetate, pidolate, citrate, gluconate, lactate or aspartate forms
  * "In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that all ten organic and inorganic Mg salts were equally efficient in restoring blood Mg levels in plasma and red blood cells in rats."
  * "However, the organic forms of Mg, in particular Mg gluconate, seem more absorbable than inorganic salts as assessed by intestinal absorption and urinary excretion."

  * This company sells a magnesium malate product, so they'd be incented to reference why malate is better.
  * Why malate form? It's cheaper. "Magnesium Malate is a preferred choice over other forms of magnesium for several reasons. It is cheaper than many amino acid chelate forms like magnesium glycinate, lysinate, or glucarate—but still offers a higher level of bioavailability than oxides and sulfates."
  * "There isn’t much research available to offer discerning comparisons between different types of magnesium. Most studies investigating the benefits of magnesium use a single type, and many fail even to describe which type they’ve."
  * Since they sell a magnesium product, t

  * TLDR; we don't really know much on mineral absorption.  Chelates looks like they are better but not a lot of studies.
