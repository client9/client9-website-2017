<p>First presented at <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-austin/welcome/">DevOpsDays Austin</a>, Texas on May 15, 2015.</p>
<p>Most memorable about this talk was a well know audience member decided I was attacking docker and made it clear to the entire convention that he was not happy with me.  Afterwards, a number of people came up to me and said “so this is what devops is all about?  Does this normally happen?  That was really rough.”  You can decide if the presentation is unfair to docker. Since then, new product lines and new companies have been formed solving software supply chain issues.</p>
