title: CSS System Font Stack Serif Charter v2
---
<p>It was originally designed in 1987 for print.  In 1987 that meant 300 dpi laser printers. That&#39;s very close to what we call retina or HiDPI for screens today. They are not exactly the same but Charter holds up well on today&#39;s screens.</p>
<p>MacOS and iOS now make Charter available as a system font, so it&#39;s great choice.  It&#39;s also a free font, and so likely installed on many linux and Windows systems as well.  </p>
<p>The next closest system font is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)">Georgia</a>, which happens to be designed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Carter">same person</a>. Georgia is a touch larger and uses proportional numbers.</p>
