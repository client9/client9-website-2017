## sindresorhus/github-markdown-css

[Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/) made a site that covers [everything about GitHub-flavored markdown](https://sindresorhus.com/github-markdown-css/). The CSS to replicate the GitHub style can be found at the matching [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)

## shurcool/github-flavored-markdown

[Dmitri Shuralyov](https://dmitri.shuralyov.com) wrote [shurcool/github-flavored-markdown](https://github.com/shurcool/github-flavored-markdown) as a extension to the [Black Friday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) markdown processor.  It takes markdown and turns it into HTML that should be identical to what GitHub produces.

It also includes a [simple CSS](https://github.com/shurcooL/github_flavored_markdown/blob/master/gfmstyle/_data/gfm.css) to replicate the GitHub look.  It's a little less complete than the Sorhus version but also a lot simpler and easier to start with.
