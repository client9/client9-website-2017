## sindresorhus/github-markdown-css

[Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/) made a site that covers just [everything about GitHub-flavored markdown](https://sindresorhus.com/github-markdown-css/). The CSS to replicate the GitHub style can be found at the matching  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)

## shurcool/github-flavored-markdown

[Dmitri Shuralyov](https://dmitri.shuralyov.com) wrote [shurcool/github-flavored-markdown](https://github.com/shurcool/github-flavored-markdown) as a gextension to [Black Friday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) markdown processor.  It turns markdown into same HTML that GitHub does.

It also includes a [simple CSS](https://github.com/shurcooL/github_flavored_markdown/blob/master/gfmstyle/_data/gfm.css) to replicate the GitHub look.  It's a little less complete than the Sorhus version but also a lot simpler and easier to start with.
