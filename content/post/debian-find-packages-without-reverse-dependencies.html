title: 'Debian: find packages without reverse dependencies'
---
<p>When trying to make minimal OS, one wants to get rid of as many non-critical packages as possible.  Under Debian, <code>apt-cache rdepends --installed</code> on a given package shows the reverse dependencies, or a list of other packages that depends on it.</p>
<p>The bash script below scans all installed packages and emits a list of packages without any reverse dependencies.</p>
<p>Packages without any reverse dependencies could be one of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Orphans - truly not used by anything. <code>apt-get purge</code> away.</li>
<li>A top-level user command, something like <code>wget</code></li>
<li>Something critical for booting. Interestingly, <code>bash</code> comes up without reverse dependencies, but it&#39;s hard to imagine Debian booting without it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
