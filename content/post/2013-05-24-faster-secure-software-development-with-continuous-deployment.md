Why don't developers care about security issues?  Why isn't security
training effective?  Why do basic application security problems
continue to exist?  One reason is that long release cycles
disenfranchise developers from caring or even knowing about security
or operational issues. Continuous Deployment helps address this by
small, but frequent, changes to the production environment.  At first,
this would seem less stable and less secure, however continuous
deployment is a lot more than "pushing code".  When done well, it can
be transformative to your software lifecycle and change your security
group from a reactive organization into a "in-house security
consultancy" that developers come to for questions and assistance.
This session will discuss how to get started with continuous
deployment and the tools and process needed to make it a security
success.
