title: Copying GitHub Markdown Style
---
<p>For many, the clean look of Github pages, issues and comments defines how markdown should be rendered. Hereâ€™s a few ways of getting the same look in your projects.</p>
<h2 id="h.2k1lg8ody3wq" class="h4 mt-4 mb-4">sindresorhus/github-markdown-css</h2>
<p><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/">Sindre Sorhus</a> made a site that covers everything about <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/github-markdown-css/">GitHub-flavored markdown</a>. The CSS to replicate the GitHub style can be found at the matching <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h.cg876kazol6o" class="h4 mt-4 mb-4">shurcool/github-flavored-markdown</h2>
<p><a href="https://dmitri.shuralyov.com">Dmitri Shuralyov</a> wrote <a href="https://github.com/shurcool/github-flavored-markdown">shurcool/github-flavored-markdown</a> as a extension to the <a href="https://github.com/russross/blackfriday">Black Friday</a> markdown processor. It takes markdown and turns it into HTML that should be identical to what GitHub produces. It also includes a <a href="https://github.com/shurcooL/github_flavored_markdown/blob/master/gfmstyle/_data/gfm.css">simple CSS file</a> to replicate the GitHub look. It&#39;s a little less complete than the Sorhus version but also a lot simpler and easier to start with.</p>
<h2 id="h.mgfg3zkgznms" class="h4 mt-4 mb-4">Roll your own with Bootstrap v4</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a> front end framework gets you quite close to the GitHub style.  No surprise, they are both written (or managed) by the same person, <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo?lang%3Den">Mark Otto</a>. Transforming the default bootstrap style to the github style is a great way of learning CSS and bootstrap.</p>
