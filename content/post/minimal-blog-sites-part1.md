title: "Minimal Blog Sites, Part 1"
---

There is a whole industry on "minimalist blogging." Sometimes the focus is on [minimalist](http://www.theminimalists.com), other times it's focus on [blogging themes](https://bylt.me/get/tru/).   Sometimes both.

There is a lot of white.  Mostly clean looking.  Frequently, single-column without sidebar.  But look under the hood (i.e. view source), oh my.  Not mimimal at all.
