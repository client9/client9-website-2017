Original abstract:

> SQLi remains a popular sport in the security arms-race. However, after
> analysis of hundreds of thousands of real world SQLi attacks, output
> from SQLi scanners, published reports, analysis of WAF source code,
> and database vendor documentation, both SQLi attackers and defenders
> have missed a few opportunities. This talk will iterate through the
> dark corners of SQL for use in new obfuscated attacks, and show why
> they are problematic for regular-expression based WAFs. This will
> point the way for new directions in SQLi research for both offense and
> defense.
